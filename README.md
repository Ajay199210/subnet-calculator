# Subnet Calculator

A lightweight and easy-to-use subnet calculator implemented in Python. This tool calculates basic network information for a given IPv4 address and CIDR notation. It is ideal for students learning Python or networking, network engineers, and anyone working with IP subnetting.

***Usage:** py subnet_test.py \<IPv4/cidr>*

***Example:** py subnet_test.py 192.168.0.1/24*

The program will display the following network info:
- Subnet Mask
-   Total Hosts
-   Usable IP Range
-   Block Size
-   Network Address
-   Broadcast Address

## Requirements
-   Python 3.x

## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/ajay199210/subnet-calculator.git
    cd subnet-calculator

## Future Enhancements
Here are some potential improvements:

-   Add IPv6 subnetting support.
-   Provide a graphical user interface (GUI).
-   Include support for exporting results to a file.
